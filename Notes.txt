These are my raw text notes to document what I'm doing for the challenge.

##Azure Account Setup##
-----------------------
Since I already have an Azure account from my AZ-900 days, I decided to use it.
I created 2 Management Groups under my Tenant Root Group, per the challenge's recommendation:
Cloud_Resume_Challenge_Dev_Test (for development)
    Azure subscription 1 (from when I studied AZ-900)
Cloud_Resume_Challenge_Prod (for when I deploy)
    Cloud_Resume_Challenge_Subscription (for when I deploy)

Additionally, I installed VScode, Azure Extensions, Azure CLI, Python3, and Azure Functions Core Tools. 

I initially had trouble logging in with "az login", but I was able to get it working using "az login --use-device-code."

##Chunk 0##
-----------
Since I already had AZ-900 from work, I can skip this step. 

##Chunk 1##
-----------
The purpose of Chunk 1 is to build a static website that will host my resume
in Azure Storage, accessible via HTTPS. 

HTML:
Since I already had a resume template that I liked (https://sheetsresume.com/resume-template/),
I figured I'd convert it into code. If I ever want to change the way my resume looks, I figure the automation
to be built later in this challenge will help make that process a lot easier. 

I don't pay for any AI chat bots, but I do have the free version of Grok avaiable to me via X;
I decided to upload the PDF of my anonymized resume to it and get it to spit out html and css for me.
Apparently PDF uploads are not available to free Grok users, so I took a screenshot of my resume and uploaded that instead.
It worked! Grok generated code that looked roughly like my current resume. 
I tested the code via CodPen (https://codepen.io/emzarts/pen/OXzmym), the website linked in the challenge docs.
