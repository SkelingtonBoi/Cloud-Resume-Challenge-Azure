These are my raw text notes to document what I'm doing for the challenge.

##Azure Account Setup##
Since I already have an Azure account from my AZ-900 days, I decided to use it.
I created 2 Management Groups under my Tenant Root Group, per the challenge's recommendation:
Cloud_Resume_Challenge_Dev_Test (for development)
    Azure subscription 1 (from when I studied AZ-900)
Cloud_Resume_Challenge_Prod (for when I deploy)
    Cloud_Resume_Challenge_Subscription (for when I deploy)

Additionally, I installed VScode, Azure Extensions, Azure CLI, Python3, and Azure Functions Core Tools. 

I initially had trouble logging in with "az login", but I was able to get it working using "az login --use-device-code."
