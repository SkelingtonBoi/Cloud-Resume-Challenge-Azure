These are my raw text notes to document what I'm doing for the challenge.

## Azure Account Setup ##
-----------------------
Since I already have an Azure account from my AZ-900 days, I decided to use it.
I created 2 Management Groups under my Tenant Root Group, per the challenge's recommendation:
Cloud_Resume_Challenge_Dev_Test (for development)
    Azure subscription 1 (from when I studied AZ-900)
Cloud_Resume_Challenge_Prod (for when I deploy)
    Cloud_Resume_Challenge_Subscription (for when I deploy)

Additionally, I installed VScode, Azure Extensions, Azure CLI, Python3, and Azure Functions Core Tools. 

I initially had trouble logging in with "az login", but I was able to get it working using "az login --use-device-code."

## Chunk 0 ##
-----------
Since I already had AZ-900 from work, I can skip this step. 

## Chunk 1 ##
-----------
The purpose of Chunk 1 is to build a static website that will host my resume
in Azure Storage, accessible via HTTPS. 

HTML:
Since I already had a resume template that I liked (https://sheetsresume.com/resume-template/),
I figured I'd convert it into code. If I ever want to change the way my resume looks, I figure the automation
to be built later in this challenge will help make that process a lot easier. 

I don't pay for any AI chat bots, but I do have the free version of Grok avaiable to me via X;
I decided to upload the PDF of my anonymized resume to it and get it to spit out html and css for me.
Apparently PDF uploads are not available to free Grok users, so I took a screenshot of my resume and uploaded that instead.
It worked! Grok generated code that looked roughly like my current resume. 
I tested the code via CodPen (https://codepen.io/emzarts/pen/OXzmym), the website linked in the challenge docs.

Posting the Static Web Page:

Resources used:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cdn/cdn-create-a-storage-account-with-cdn

I was able to get my resume site up using Azure CDN, at this endpoint: https://cdn-bhuegele-endpoint-1.azureedge.net/
The web page will require some edits, but it's 80% there.

DNS Record and Enabling HTTPS:

Endpoint: https://cdn-bhuegele-endpoint-1.azureedge.net
Hostname: https://bhuegeleteststorage.z13.web.core.windows.net

Using this article, I got my custom DNS record from CloudFlare to resolve to my CDN endpoint:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cdn/cdn-map-content-to-custom-domain?tabs=dns-provider%2Cazure-portal%2Cazure-portal-cleanup
After fighting with CloudFlare for a minute, I realized that the way it displays 
the CNAME record information doesn't match the MS docs exactly!

I was able to add the custom domain www.skelingtonboi.com to my CDN endpoint! I chose to let the CDN
manage the certificate; according to the docs, it can take up to 24 hours to validate the custom domain.
When looking under the CDN endpoint, there is a status menu that appears with the validation steps after you enable HTTPS.
It only took about 30 minutes for my domain to be validated using Azure's DigiCert!

Now if you got to https://www.skelingtonboi.com you will see my static site/resume!

Reflection on Chunk 1:
----------------------
I believe I will change my approach to the content of my website, as I 
don't want to exercise bad OPSEC. Having said that, I know I'll tell a litte bit about myself
and give links to my LinkedIn, GitHub, etc. I'm sure I'll link to Credly for my certifications too. 

I chased a rabbit of getting my custom domain validated on my storage account, which I realized I didn't need
since the CDN endpoint would do the hard work. 

I'm glad that purchasing the Domain name from CloudFlare was easy, I just wish their webGUI for adding 
the records did a better job of conveying what it was doing.

## Chunk 2 ##
-------------
This part will be challenging for me, as I am a sysadmin by training and not a developer (especially not a web developer!).
Although step 7 is creating the Javascript code, apparently it's not done until Chunk 3, which confused me. 

The main purpose of this chunk is to build the backend API, so that's what I'll focus on.
Note: When creating a Cosmos DB "Table", you have to look under the "Other" tab when creating a new DB.

Azure Functions are very confusing, so I'm watching these videos:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieYrBWmkfno - A Cloud Guru
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpZCwzYVNpA - John Savill

After doing some digging, I decided to go back to NoSQL for the DB, as it seems like folks on the forums
have had more luck with it and there was more documentation from what I could tell.

From what I've found, Microsoft's Azure docs tend to favor C# in a lot of cases, so I might re-factor the back end and use it.

After a lot of rabbit chasing, I found that the code here was the most helpful: https://github.com/Sasquatch8946/azure-resume/tree/main/backend/api.
I built my function using the code referenced above, in a Python V2 HTTP Trigger Azure Function.
CoPilot helped me figure out my syntax issues when I customized the code.

## Chunk 3 ##
-------------
Chunk 3 is all about hooking the backend and frontend together to make a working website!
